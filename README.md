### Everything is explained in the good_luck.ipynb file.


# Project Overview


## Environment Setup
- Describe the required Python version and dependencies.
- Instructions for creating and activating a virtual environment.

## Baseline Model
- Outline the initial model architecture and training process.

## Enhancements
- Summarize improvements and additional features tested.

## Evaluation
- Explain metrics and validation approach used to compare results.

To reproduce the baseline evaluation on a small subset of the dataset, install
the project dependencies and run:

```bash
pip install -e .
python baseline_eval.py 5
```

This will compute the Valid Syntax Rate (VSR) and mean IOU for five examples and
print the metrics used to update `results.csv`.

## Report Structure
- Provide an overview of how to present findings and conclusions.
